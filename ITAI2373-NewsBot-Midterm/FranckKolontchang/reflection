1. Technical Mastery: Which NLP techniques did you find most challenging? Most useful?
The most challenging NLP techniques were dependency parsing and named entity recognition (NER) due to their complexity and the 
variability of sentence structures. The most useful techniques were TF-IDF vectorization for text representation and sentiment
analysis, which offered meaningful insights into the tone of the news content.

2. Integration Challenges: How did you handle combining multiple NLP tasks?
We tackled integration challenges by designing the pipeline in modular steps—text preprocessing, feature extraction, sentiment
scoring, syntactic parsing, and classification—each feeding into the next. We validated outputs at each stage, particularly 
when merging TF-IDF and sentiment features, ensuring shape and scale compatibility.

3. Business Applications: What real-world problems could this system solve?

Our NewsBot system can support media monitoring, brand reputation management, automated news classification, and public 
sentiment tracking. For instance, it could help PR firms filter for uplifting entertainment news or allow political analysts
to monitor shifts in sentiment.

4. Ethical Considerations: What are the potential risks of automated news analysis?

The risks include algorithmic bias, misclassification, and over-reliance on automation. If the dataset is unbalanced, results
may reinforce stereotypes or misrepresent sentiment. Ethical deployment requires transparency, bias testing, and human 
oversight.

5. Future Learning: What NLP topics are you most excited to explore next?
We are excited to explore transformer-based models like BERT and GPT for deeper contextual understanding, as well as 
multilingual NLP, which would allow our system to scale globally and handle diverse languages and expressions.

6. Team Collaboration: How did you divide work and ensure quality?
Group 5 (Franck, Iman, Kimberly) divided the workload based on strengths. Franck led the coding and integration, Kimberly 
worked on sentiment modeling and visualization, and Iman handled data preparation and business insights. We held regular 
check-ins to maintain consistency and troubleshoot as a team.

7. Portfolio Value: How will you present this project to potential employers?
We plan to showcase this project via a narrated video demo, GitHub repository, and a 2-page report. Emphasizing real-world applicability, full NLP pipeline implementation, and teamwork will make this a standout project for our portfolios.
